# SpeakEasyReactBoilerPlate
This is a React boilerplate based on SpeakEasy.tools. It was created using the npm create-react-app command but has been modified to include an ApolloProvider, Auth0Provider, Material UI Theme Provider, React SPA routing, and possibly some other features I don't remember ATM.
